    <h2>Assignment 53</h2>


    <p>
        The factorial of a natural number is a number multiplied by "number minus one", then by "number minus two", and
        so on
        till 1. The factorial of n is denoted as n!
    </p>
    <p>
        The task is to write a function factorial(n) that calculates n! using recursive calls.
    </p>

    <script>

        function factorial(n) {
            if (n == 1) return 1;
            return n *= factorial(n - 1);
        }


        console.log(factorial(5));
