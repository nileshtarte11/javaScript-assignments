    <h2>Assignment 54</h2>

    <p>The sequence of Fibonacci numbers has the formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. In other words, the next number is a sum of
        the two
        preceding ones.<br>

        First two numbers are 1, then 2(1+1), then 3(1+2), 5(2+3) and so on: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.... <br>

        Fibonacci numbers are related to the Golden ratio and many natural phenomena around us.<br>

        Write a function fib(n) that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.</p>

    <script>
        function fib(n) {
            return n <= 1 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
        }

        console.log(fib(7));
    </script>
